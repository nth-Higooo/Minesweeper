<p>All you need to do in this solving game is find and determine all of the mines are hidden under the squares in the definitely area. We will provide for you the flags to mark the square you think has a mine. Moreover, to exactly know which places will contain the mine, you need to check the square has a number that you have opened or it appeared before. The number you see on the square is the way for you to find the solution, it will represent all the mines have under the 3x3 area- which the square contains number is the center.Example: The center square of the 3x3 area is "2", which means there are 2 mines around (both mines are marked by flags).The image will explain to you specifically about that is:</p>
